# Pipelined MIPS Processor
This simulator is a tool to simulate any given assembly code using an implemented MIPS processor architecture that supports pipelining and and forwarding.

The input will an assembly code to our simulator which coverts it to hexadecimal numbers (machine code) to can be executed through our Pipelined MIPS processor

more information, details and tests will be found in this [documentation](https://github.com/BeshoyAnwar/Pipelined-MIPS-Processor/raw/master/PipelinedMIPSDocumentation.pdf)
# How to run
go through the steps in this [StartUpGuide](https://github.com/BeshoyAnwar/Pipelined-MIPS-Processor/raw/master/MIPS-simulator-StartUPGuide.pdf)


The package contains all verilog modules for the processor, the python files for the assembler,tests,documentation, startUP Guide and more to download click [here](https://github.com/BeshoyAnwar/Pipelined-MIPS-Processor/raw/master/pipelined-MIPS-Processor.rar)
